# nvim-init
My neovim config

## Installation

Clone somewhere your user has access to, which is not the `~/.config` folder. (for example `~/git-repos/nvim-init`)

Run the `install` script.

This might take a moment.

At the last step the script runs neovim.

Neovim is technically usable at this point but I'd recommend to wait if it still seems to install something and close neovim when it's finished.
