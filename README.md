# nvim-init
My neovim config

## Installation

Run the `install` script to create a symbolic link at `~/.config/nvim` to wherever you put this repo. (obviously not required if you cloned it there)

This might take a moment.

At the last step the script runs neovim.

Neovim is technically usable at this point but I'd recommend to wait if it still seems to install something and close neovim when it's finished.
